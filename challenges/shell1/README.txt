    -----------====== The Story  ======--------------
 
One day you download a blacklist of domains that are known to 
provide malicious content. (you find an example of it in the
file blacklist.txt in the current directory).
At that point you start wondering if, in the past, you visited
some of these entries...

  -----------====== The Challenge  ======--------------

You want to print the domains in "blacklist.txt" that appear
in the "urls.txt" file (a snapshot of the urls visited by
your browser in the last 6 months).

   -----------====== Submission  ======--------------

Write your commands in a file called "solution.sh" 
Then test if it works by running:
 >  bash solution.sh
The output should look like:
 ww2.bizitangel.ru
 www.webro.ro

If so, you can proceed and submit your solution file, your submitted file will be checked against the list of blacklist and urls file.
